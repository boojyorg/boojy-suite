> **⚠️ SUPERSEDED (2026-05-29).** This is the original vision and describes a lineup that no longer matches the build (no Boojy Notes; Draw, Animate, and Score as standalone apps). See **[[Boojy Suite — Vision (2026 Refresh)]]** for the current source of truth. Kept for history.

# 🎨 Boojy Suite – Vision Document

> **Tagline:** Creativity without limits.  
> **Mission:** Make professional creative tools free, accessible, and ethical for everyone.

---

## 1. Why Boojy Exists

### The Problem

Creative software has become expensive, closed, and extractive:

- **Adobe Creative Cloud:** £66.49/month (£798/year) for perpetual subscriptions
- **Apple Logic Pro:** £200 one-time, Final Cut Pro X: £300 one-time (but macOS-only)
- **Canva Pro:** £13/month with paywalls on essential features
- **Data tracking:** Your projects, habits, and creations monitored and monetized

For students, hobbyists, and independent creators, these costs are prohibitive. You're locked into subscriptions, surveilled by analytics, and held hostage by proprietary file formats.

### The Solution

**Boojy Suite** is a complete ecosystem of creative tools that is:

✅ **Free forever** – No subscriptions, no paywalls, no trials  
✅ **Open-source** – Code is public, auditable, and community-driven (after v1.0)  
✅ **Privacy-first** – No telemetry, no ads, no data collection without consent  
✅ **Cross-platform** – Works on Windows, Mac, Linux, iPad, phone, and (selectively) web  
✅ **Ethical** – Respects users, supports creators, reinvests all revenue into development

---

## 2. Core Principles

### 1. Free to Create

Every app is free to download and use—forever. No feature restrictions, no time limits, no "upgrade to pro" upsells.  
**Commercial use is encouraged.** Freelancers, small studios, businesses—use Boojy Suite for paid work without licensing fees.

### 2. Open-Source (After v1.0)

Apps go open-source after they reach v1.0 stability (feature-complete + stable). This ensures:

- **Transparency** – You can audit the code
- **Longevity** – Community can maintain if needed
- **Trust** – No hidden tracking or backdoors
- **License:** MIT (maximum freedom for users and developers)

### 3. Privacy-First

- No telemetry by default (opt-in analytics only, if you choose)
- No ads, ever
- No data mining or selling user information
- Your projects stay yours
- Boojy Cloud is encrypted and never scans your files

### 4. Human + AI Development

Boojy Suite is developed and designed by Tyr Bujac with AI tools (Claude Code, ChatGPT) assisting with code generation, debugging, and idea refinement. All creative and architectural decisions are human-made.

**Why this matters:**

- Speeds up development without sacrificing quality
- Demonstrates the future of indie software creation
- Maintains transparency (we're open about using AI as a tool)

### 5. Accessibility

- **Lightweight apps** that run on modest hardware (no 16GB RAM requirement)
- **Intuitive UI** inspired by GarageBand and iMovie (learn by doing, not by reading manuals)
- **Free for education** – Students, teachers, schools, universities (no licensing fees)
- **Works offline** – No internet required (except for Cloud sync)

### 6. Community-Driven

Your feedback shapes priorities. Early testers, GitHub discussions, YouTube devlog comments, and feature requests guide what gets built next.

## 7. Boojy Cloud: Creative-Aware Storage

### Why Not Just Use Google Drive?

**Generic cloud storage** (Google Drive, Dropbox, OneDrive) doesn't understand creative projects:

- ❌ No version history per save (only daily backups)
- ❌ No creative previews (generic file icons)
- ❌ No cross-app integration (Audio can't reference Draw files)
- ❌ No offline-first workflow (must download before editing)

**Boojy Cloud** is built specifically for creative workflows:

- ✅ Auto-versioning (every save creates a version, restore any previous state)
- ✅ Smart previews (thumbnails show actual artwork, waveforms, designs)
- ✅ Cross-app awareness (open Draw file in Design seamlessly)
- ✅ Offline-first (work without internet, sync when connected)
- ✅ Privacy (no file scanning for ads or AI training)

### Storage Tiers

|Plan|Storage|Price|Target User|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Free**|1 GB|£0/mo|Try before you buy, casual users|
|**Plus**|10 GB|£2/mo|Hobbyists, regular creators (~50 projects)|
|**Pro**|100 GB|£5/mo|Active creators, small studios (~500 projects)|
|**Max**|1 TB|£15/mo|Professionals, classrooms, teams (~5000 projects)|

**Optional third-party integration:** Free users can connect Google Drive, Dropbox, or OneDrive as backup (your choice, your control).

### Revenue Model

**Break-even:** ~100 Plus subscribers (£200/month) covers hosting, AI tools, domain costs.

**Sustainability:** ~1,000 paying Cloud users (mix of Plus/Pro/Max) = £5,000/month = full-time sustainable development.

### ⚠️ Important: App Store Subscription Fees

**Apple and Google take a 30% cut of in-app subscriptions** (reduced to 15% after first year per subscriber).

**This significantly impacts revenue:**

- **Direct subscription (website):** User pays £2 → You receive £2 (100%)
- **iOS/Android subscription:** User pays £2 → You receive £1.40 (70%) or £1.70 (85% after year 1)

**Boojy's Strategy:**

✅ **Primary:** Direct subscriptions via boojy.org (no middleman, 100% revenue)  
✅ **iOS/Android:** Apps are completely free to download and use  
✅ **Cloud subscription:** Users directed to website to subscribe (avoids 30% fee)  
✅ **Alternative:** Users can link their own Google Drive/Dropbox (free tier stays free)

**Why this matters:**

- At 100 subscribers, 30% cut = £60/month lost (£720/year) — that's significant for sustainability
- Encouraging website subscriptions keeps more money for development
- Apps remain 100% free on all platforms (no paywalls, no feature restrictions)

**User-friendly approach:**

- In-app message: "Subscribe to Boojy Cloud on boojy.org to support development directly"
- One-click link to website subscription page
- Transparent about why (more money goes to making better apps)

---

## 8. Business Model: Sustainability Without Exploitation

Boojy Suite is **free forever**, funded through **ethical, optional support**:

|Revenue Stream|Description|Estimated Contribution|
|---|---|---|
|**Boojy Cloud subscriptions**|Plus (£2), Pro (£5), Max (£15) tiers|**Primary revenue** (70-80%)|
|**Buddy Music fees**|10% of artist sales on platform|Secondary (10-15%)|
|**Donations**|One-time via Buy Me a Coffee, Ko-fi, Stripe|Community support (5-10%)|
|**YouTube ad revenue**|Monthly devlogs + tutorial videos|Supplemental (2-5%)|
|**Merchandise**|Ethical print-on-demand (shirts, mugs, stickers, tote bags, posters)|Supplemental (2-5%)|

### Transparency Commitment

**Monthly updates published publicly:**

- Development progress (features completed, bugs fixed)
- **Donation transparency** (monthly donations received, thank you to supporters)
- User growth (downloads, active users, Cloud subscribers)
- Roadmap adjustments (what's next based on feedback)

**Example transparency post:**

> _"October 2025: Development update—Audio v0.5 shipped with 47 bug fixes. Thank you to our 23 donors this month (£287 total)! Next milestone: Draw v0.5 Beta in November. Goal: 50 total donors by year-end to sustain full-time development."_

### Financial Projections

|User Base|Monthly Revenue|Key Streams|Milestone|
|---|---|---|---|
|**100 users**|£200-£300|Cloud Plus subs + donations|Break-even (covers hosting, tools)|
|**1,000 users**|£3,000-£5,000|Cloud (Plus/Pro/Max) + Buddy Music|Sustainable (full-time development)|
|**10,000 users**|£20,000-£25,000|Cloud + Buddy + merch + YouTube|Small company (hire contributors)|
|**100,000 users**|£150,000-£200,000|Scaled Cloud subs + ecosystem|Boojy Ltd (full team)|

## 9. Buddy Music: Companion Platform

### What Is Buddy Music?

**Spotify + iTunes hybrid** for independent artists:

- **Free streaming** (like Spotify—discover indie music)
- **Buy-to-own** (like iTunes—support artists directly, own the tracks)
- **90/10 revenue split** (artist keeps 90%, platform takes 10%)
- **Playful branding** (teddy bear mascots, vibrant colors—distinct from Boojy Suite's professional tone)

### Integration with Boojy Audio

**Seamless workflow:**

1. Create music in Boojy Audio
2. Click "Publish to Buddy Music"
3. Upload track with metadata (title, artist, cover art from Boojy Draw)
4. Set price (free, £1, £5, etc.) or streaming-only
5. Share with fans (streaming link + buy link)

**Why it works:**

- ✅ Complements Boojy Suite (create → publish in one ecosystem)
- ✅ Helps indie artists (no gatekeepers, 90% revenue)
- ✅ Separate branding avoids confusion (Buddy = fun/playful, Boojy = professional)
- ✅ Revenue share sustains both platforms

### Business Model

- **Artist sales:** Platform takes 10% (artist keeps 90%)
- **No ads or subscriptions** (listener-side is always free)
- **Cross-promotion:** Buddy Music users discover Boojy Audio ("Made with Boojy Audio" badges on tracks)

**Launch timing:** Soft launch after Boojy Audio is stable (Month 4-6).

---

## 10. Community & Content Strategy

### YouTube Devlogs

**Monthly devlog videos** (10 minutes, well-produced):

- **Structure:**
    - 0:00-0:30 – Hook ("This month I added real-time collaboration to Boojy Cloud")
    - 0:30-2:00 – Progress showcase (show features working)
    - 2:00-7:00 – Deep dive on one interesting problem solved
    - 7:00-9:00 – What's next + roadmap update
    - 9:00-10:00 – Call to action (test beta, donate, follow)

**First public devlog:** Month 3-4 (after Preview phase, when you have something to show)

### Social Media

- **Twitter/X:** Progress reels, feature teasers, poll community on decisions
- **Instagram:** Visual content (Draw/Design showcases, UI screenshots)
- **Reddit:** r/WeAreTheMusicMakers, r/DigitalPainting, r/opensource (share milestones, gather feedback)

### GitHub

- **Public development:** Roadmap, issues, discussions (after v1.0 per app)
- **Community contributions:** Accept pull requests after v1.0 stability
- **Transparency:** Changelog, release notes, version history

### Community Interaction

- **GitHub Discussions** (not Discord initially) – Async, searchable, professional
- **Consider Discord** once 1,000 active users (demand-driven, not preemptive)

## 14. Why Now? Why Boojy?

### The Timing Is Right

**2025 is the perfect moment for Boojy Suite:**

✅ **Adobe fatigue:** Creators are tired of £660/year subscriptions  
✅ **Open-source momentum:** Blender, Krita, Kdenlive prove free tools can compete  
✅ **AI acceleration:** Human+AI development makes solo/small-team ambitious projects feasible  
✅ **Creator economy boom:** Millions of YouTubers, TikTokers, indie artists need affordable tools  
✅ **Privacy concerns:** Users want tools that don't spy on them

### What Makes Boojy Different

**Not just "free Adobe"—Boojy is something new:**

- **Unified ecosystem:** Apps talk to each other (Audio ↔ Draw ↔ Design ↔ Cloud)
- **Hobbyist-first:** GarageBand/iMovie-level approachability, not pro intimidation
- **Ethical foundation:** No dark patterns, no data exploitation, transparent finances
- **Community ownership:** Open-source means Boojy outlives any single developer
- **Integrated platform:** Buddy Music closes the loop (create → publish → earn)
