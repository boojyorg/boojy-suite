## Smart Layer System

### Auto-Create Layers (Default Behavior)

```
Import photo → Creates "screenshot" layer 🖼️
Draw rectangle → Creates "Rectangle" layer 📐
Add text → Creates "TOP 10 TIPS" layer 🔤
Paint with brush → Creates "Brush" layer 🖼️
Draw circle → Creates "Ellipse" layer 📐
```

**Each tool automatically creates appropriate layer type**

### Drag-to-Merge (Flexible Organization)

```
Initial state:
  📐 Ellipse
  📐 Rectangle
  🔤 TOP 10 TIPS
  🖼️ screenshot

User drags "Ellipse" onto "Rectangle":
  📐 Rectangle (contains both shapes)
    ├─ Rectangle
    └─ Ellipse
  🔤 TOP 10 TIPS
  🖼️ screenshot
```

**Benefits:**

- Clean by default (separate layers, organized)
- Flexible when needed (merge to reduce clutter)
- Non-destructive (can always separate again)
- Visual feedback (highlight shows merge target)

### Smart Painting Behavior

**Scenario A: No layer selected**

```
User picks Brush → Starts painting
→ Auto-creates new layer "Brush" 🖼️
→ Non-destructive (separate from other content)
```

**Scenario B: Image layer selected**

```
User clicks "screenshot" layer → Picks Brush → Paints
→ Merges with screenshot pixels (destructive)
→ User explicitly chose to paint on that layer
```

**Result: Default is non-destructive, explicit selection allows merging**

---

## Context-Aware UI

Top bar adapts to show relevant options:

### Vector Shape Selected

```
Fill: [■ Blue ▼]  Stroke: [□ Black ▼]  Width: [2px]  Corner: [0px]  [Align ▼]
```

### Text Layer Selected

```
Font: [Helvetica ▼]  Size: [24px]  [B I U]  Align: [≡]  Color: [■]  Spacing: [0]
```

### Image Layer Selected

```
Brightness: [slider]  Contrast: [slider]  Saturation: [slider]  Temperature: [slider]
```

### Multiple Layers Selected

```
[Align Left] [Align Center] [Align Right] [Distribute ▼] [Group] [Merge]
```

**User never sees irrelevant options – UI stays clean and focused**

Top bar: Color → White
Top bar: Alignment → Center
→ Large, bold white text on dark background
```

### Step 9: Add Decorative Circle

```
Press O (Ellipse tool)
Hold Shift, drag to create perfect circle in top-right corner
→ Auto-creates Layer 4: "Ellipse" 📐
→ Top bar: Fill → Yellow
→ Top bar: Stroke → None
→ Bright accent shape

Optional: Drag "Ellipse" layer onto "Rectangle" layer
→ Both shapes now in one layer (cleaner organization)
```

### Step 10: Paint Arrow (Optional Detail)

```
Option A (Non-destructive – default):
  Press B (Brush tool)
  Choose red color, size 20px
  Paint arrow pointing at face
  → Auto-creates Layer 5: "Brush" 🖼️
  → Arrow on separate layer (can delete later)

Option B (Merge with screenshot):
  Click "screenshot" layer first (explicit selection)
  Press B (Brush tool)
  Paint arrow
  → Arrow merges with screenshot pixels (destructive)
  → User explicitly chose to paint on that layer
```

### Export

```
File → Export
Format: PNG
Quality: High
[Export]
→ Saves as "YouTube-Thumbnail.png"
→ Flattens all layers to single 1280×720 image
```

## Technical Implementation

### Smart Layer Data Structure

```javascript
Layer {
  id: string
  name: string
  type: "smart" // All layers are "smart" (can contain multiple content types)
  
  // Content (each optional)
  pixelContent: {
    imageData: ImageData | null
    brushStrokes: BrushStroke[] | null
  }
  
  vectorContent: {
    shapes: Shape[] | null  // Rectangle, Ellipse, Pen paths
    paths: Path[] | null
  }
  
  textContent: {
    blocks: TextBlock[] | null
  }
  
  // Properties
  opacity: number (0-100)
  blendMode: string ("normal" | "multiply" | "screen" | "overlay" | "add")
  visible: boolean
  locked: boolean
  
  // Hierarchy
  children: Layer[] | null  // For grouped/merged layers
  parent: Layer | null
  
  // Effects
  effects: {
    dropShadow: DropShadow | null
    stroke: StrokeEffect | null
  }
  
  // Transform
  transform: {
    x: number
    y: number
    scaleX: number
    scaleY: number
    rotation: number
  }
}
```

### Rendering Pipeline

```
For each visible layer (bottom to top):
  1. Apply transform (position, scale, rotation)
  2. Render pixel content (if exists)
  3. Render vector shapes (if exists)
  4. Render text (if exists)
  5. Apply layer effects (drop shadow, stroke)
  6. Apply blend mode
  7. Apply opacity
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Layer limit:** 50 layers max in Preview (raise to 100+ in v1.0 after optimization)
- **Smart rendering:** Only re-render layers that changed
- **Viewport culling:** Skip rendering layers outside visible canvas
- **Performance mode:** Auto-reduce quality if FPS drops below 30
    - Lower anti-aliasing
    - Reduce shadow quality
    - Notification: "⚡ Performance Mode (rendering faster)"
- **Warning at 40+ layers:** "Canvas is slowing down. Merge some layers?"
